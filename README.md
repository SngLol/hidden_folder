# hidden_folder
Lock a folder behind a password and make it invisible.

This program "0.bat" will hide a folder originally named "Hide" so it'll become invisible
as well as making it inaccessible by anyone. When running "0.bat" it will do nothing but wait for an input.
This input is the password for opening the folder, but it doesn't say that.
The password is stored inside the hidden folder to prevent anyone from accessing the password from the outside.
A readme.txt file is featured inside "Folder" with instructions on how to use the program and what to do in different scenarios.
Please read through the whole readme.txt file and ensure you understand everything before you delete it.
This program is nothing but something I made for fun on my school laptop, so use it in whatever way you desire. I simply don't care.

Feel free to contact me through email if something is wrong or if you've lost your folder.
You should not expect a quick response as emailing is not something I do on a daily basis.
